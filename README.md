This repository is a collection of introductory exercises to the Python programming language I wrote while taking night classes at Galvanize in Austin, TX.
***

The main areas of study were as follows:

* Numbers
* Strings
* Conditionals
* While and For Loops

as well as the study of mutable and immutable data types including:

* Lists
* Tuples
* Dictionaries
* Sets


The course finished with the study of creating basic functions and working with objects created from custom classes.  Also, we briefly touched on Pandas and NumPy and how they are used in the feild of Data Science.

The most extensive code I wrote involved creating a command line version of Tic Tac Toe.
